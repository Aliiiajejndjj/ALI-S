i.Describe Named Entity Recognition. 

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is an essential task in natural language processing aimed at identifying and categorizing specific entities within a given text. These entities encompass various types like individuals, organizations, places, dates, quantities, and more. NER typically involves breaking down the input text into smaller units, assigning them specific tags indicating their roles, and then classifying them into predefined categories. This process often relies on machine learning methods such as statistical models or deep learning algorithms trained on annotated datasets. NER holds significant importance across a range of NLP applications, including retrieving information, answering questions, and analyzing sentiments, as it allows for extracting structured data from unstructured text.

ii. Write a python code to recognize named entities in a document. The input should be a text file containing 200 - 300 words in it. The output should be written to another file. 


Consider the 	Zacharyâ€™s karate club network from the movie karate kids. Here Zachary tried to analyze conflicts and fission in small groups. The dataset called karate.gml 	can be read using NetworkX and can be obtained from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7985174.v1 .[GML - Graph Modelling Language.]  It contains 34 nodes representing individuals within the karate club. The edges in the network are given by interactions between two individuals outside the activities of the club such as actual lessons or meetings. 
		 	 	 		
i. create a graph from the 	karate.gml file. Display all the basic information about the network.
ii. Store all the metadata of the actors in the network.
iii. Calculate all types of centrality (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, pagerank centrality). Analyse the nodes based on the centrality values. Write a note on this. 
iv. Find the possible k-components of the network and the clustering coefficient.
v. Find out the communities using Girvan-Newman algorithm and Louvain method.
